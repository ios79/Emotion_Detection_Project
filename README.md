# Emotion_Detection_Project
Emotion detection using deep learning to classify facial expressions as Happy or Not Happy.

## Project Overview
This project focuses on emotion detection using deep learning to classify facial expressions as either *Happy* or *Not Happy*. It leverages a deep learning model trained on image data, applying convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transfer learning techniques to achieve high accuracy in emotion classification.

## Data Source
The dataset used for this project contains 4,446 images, each 48x48 pixels in grayscale, labeled as *Happy* or *Not Happy*. You can access the dataset [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xESsWYBfx3FzR7-n-QWd3Sqh4hd2GmgF/view?usp=drive_link).

## Methods and Techniques
- **Data Preprocessing**: Each image was resized, normalized, and converted to grayscale to standardize inputs for the model.
- **Models Used**:
  - **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)**: Used as a baseline to evaluate the data before applying more complex models.
  - **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**: A CNN model was developed to improve accuracy with image-specific features.
  - **Transfer Learning (VGG16)**: Transfer learning with VGG16 was utilized to further enhance performance, leveraging a pre-trained model on a large dataset.
- **Performance Metrics**: Test accuracy, ROC-AUC, and F1 score were used to evaluate and compare model performance.

## Key Results
- **Best Model**: The optimized CNN model achieved a test accuracy of 87% and an ROC-AUC of 0.94.
- **Model Comparison**: The CNN and VGG16 transfer learning models significantly outperformed the baseline ANN.
